### Requirements ###

 * Dedicated Team Fortress 2 server (windows or linux)
 * Metamod + Sourcemod

### Optional Plugins ###

* [SourceBans++](https://github.com/sbpp/sourcebans-pp)
* [Discord/Slack API](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=292663)


### Installation ###

1. Create a dedicated TF2 server and install metamod + sourcemod, and the extensions and plugins above. Ensure that the server and plugins work before continuing.
2. Configure the config in whichever way you like.
3. You should be able to connect if everything was set up correctly. Using cheats without permissions will now, depending on your config, lead to warnings, kicks, bans or notifications.
